## Contributing

We are thrilled that you are interested in contributing to this project.

If you have suggestions for how this project could be improved, or want to or want to report a bug, then please open an issue. We love all kinds of contributions. If you have questions, we'd love to hear them too - you can either open an issue or reach out to project leadership directly at mmckerns[@]uqfoundation.org.

We also love PRs. Please feel free to submit a PR. If you're thinking of opening a large PR, or a PR that implements a significant change to existing code, then we advise opening up an issue first to discuss your proposed change. Doing so can make it easier to get your contribution merged. If you're not sure how to open a PR, check the links to the resources below.


## Reporting issues

When reporting issues please include as much detail as possible about your operating system, python version, package version, and the versions of any relevant package dependencies.  Whenever possible, it is strongly suggested to include a brief, self-contained code example that demonstrates the issue you are experiencing. Doing so makes it easier for us to try to reproduce your issue, which is the first step in working toward solving it. If your example code generates a traceback, feel free to also include the traceback as it can be very useful in diagnosing the issue.

Here are a few things that you can do to increase the likelihood your pull request will be accepted:

- Follow standards for style and code quality.
- Write tests that confirm the behavior of any new code.
- Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
- If you have a large or complex pull request, then please do open an issue first to discuss your proposed change.
