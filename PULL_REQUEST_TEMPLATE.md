Thank you so much for your PR!  To help us review your contribution, please
consider the following points:

- Create a new branch for your changes and open the PR from your new branch.

- The PR title should summarize the proposed changes, for example
  "Drop support for python 2.7". Avoid non-descriptive titles such as
  "Addresses issue #8576". Do not include the issue number in the title.

- The summary should provide at least 1-2 sentences describing the PR
  in detail. Why is this change required? What problem does it solve?

- If this PR fixes an issue, please read https://tinyurl.com/auto-closing,
  and follow the formatting suggestions to link relevant issues to this PR.

- If you are contributing fixes to docstrings, please pay attention to
  docstring formatting.  In particular, note the difference between using
  single backquotes, double backquotes, and asterisks in the markup.

We understand that PRs can sometimes be overwhelming, especially as the
reviews start coming in.  Please let us know if the reviews are unclear or
the recommended next step seems overly demanding, if you would like help in
addressing a reviewer's comments, or if you have been waiting too long to hear
back on your PR.
